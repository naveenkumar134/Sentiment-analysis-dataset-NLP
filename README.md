Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.
By extending the capabilities of NLP, NLU provides context to understand what is meant in any text. Sentiment Analysis (SA) takes NLU one step further. Sentiment Analysis identifies whether a message is positive, negative or neutral.
NLTK, or the Natural Language Toolkit, is one of the leading libraries for building Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, thus making it a top solution for sentiment analysis. It provides useful tools and algorithms such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, and named entity recognition.
